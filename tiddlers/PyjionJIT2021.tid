* ''Summary'':
** This talk will cover the design ideas of a JIT for CPython, optimisations, and future potential.
* ''Thoughts'':
** More of an academic talk, but interesting since it's drop-in, and thus no need to sacrifice compatibility like you do with pypy - also of note is apparently the speaker is the author of a book on cpython internals: https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/
* ''Notes'':
**  Pyjion -> pronounced Pigeon. Ha!
** CPython Performance
*** N-Body algorithm, slow compared to Node.js, why?
**** Temporary objects are costly
**** overhead with the evaluation loop
**** very dynamic, tough optimizations
**** gc is blocking
** JIT Compiler for Pyton
*** JIT options
**** Numba, decorator, requires code to change
**** pyston, closed source - LLVM
**** pypy, a lot of less compatibility with C extensions
** Pyjion
*** JIT compiler, -not- another interpreter (Python 3.9), works in Cpython
*** Focus on Compatibility
*** startup overhead must be minimal, and shouldn't rerquire changes to code where you can deploy anywhere
*** Pyjion inserts itself between the compiler and evaluation
**** ECMA 335 -> ryuJIT -> X86/x86(?)/ARM
**** ~15 optimizations currently, aiming for 100
