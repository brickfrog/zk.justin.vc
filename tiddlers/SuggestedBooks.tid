Mostly keeping this as a mechanism to keep track of books I've seen mentioned or suggested and that looked interesting to me, and where/when it was suggested to me in what context. Normally I'd add them to [[Goodreads]] or somesuch, (maybe sync?) but I'm usually on my desktop and have tiddlywiki open on a side monitor.
