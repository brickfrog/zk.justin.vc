Tiddler type, the name of which stands for ''P''erson, ''A''nimal, or ''O''rganization.

Any PAO which is defined should be written ~CamelCase and given a tiddler. The tiddler need not contain any meaningful content (a one-sentence summary would be nice but isn't strictly necessary). This is strictly a matter of creating connections between tiddlers of other types that reference the same person. Always rendering these as tiddlers ensures we don't think the PAO is unimportant, then not realize a cluster is beginning to build.
